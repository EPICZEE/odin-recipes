    The Frenchest omelette you'll dare lay your eyes upon

    <p>This here omelette is so french you'll actually get a french citizenship upon tasting it.</p>
    <p>This is by far the easiest and simplist method to get a french citizenship.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 fresh eggs</li>
        <li>Quarter teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>Half teaspoon cold water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne or white pepper to taste (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs, salt, and water together in a mixing bowl. Whisk until mixture is very liquid and whites are completely blended in, 1 or 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat 1.5 tablespoons butter in a 9 or 10 inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. As soon as butter melts and before it starts to sizzle, pour in the whisked eggs. Stire in a circular pattern with a heat-proof spatula, lifting and "scrambling" eggs, shaking pan to keep leveling out the mixture, and scraping down the sides. Continue stirring until shaking the pan no longer levels the eggs.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low. Using the spatula, smooth the surface of the eggs to move runny eggs to less runny spots, working toward an even thickness. As soon as surface is wet but not runny, remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Slide omelette to edge of pan. Flip onto a plate with the seam side down. Even out the shape, if necessary. You can tuck in the ends, if you like. Brush surface with a but more butter. dust with cayenne pepper.</li>
    </ol>
